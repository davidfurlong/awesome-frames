# Awesome Frames

## Introduction

This repository is your ultimate guide to understanding, building, and using **Frames**â€”interactive and authenticated mini-applications that can be embedded in websites and apps across multiple ecosystems like Farcaster, XMTP, and Lens. Whether you're a developer looking to build Frames or a user interested in exploring what's possible, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

## What Are Frames?

Frames are a standard for creating small, interactive, and authenticated experiences that can be embedded in other apps or websites. Think of them as mini-web applications that can handle anything from simple polls to complex interactive galleries. With Frames, you can extend the functionality of websites and apps, making them more dynamic and engaging.

## Open Frames

**Open Frames** is a standard designed to ensure that Frames work across different ecosystems (e.g., XMTP, Lens). This means you can create a Frame once and have it function seamlessly in multiple platforms.
